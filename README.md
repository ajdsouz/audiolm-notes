Any thing you find cool and relevant, do add to the repo by creating a PR (this also goes for new topics, like Diffusion). The way to do this is

1. Create a branch on your fork ```git branch -M diffusion```.

2. Add your notes and commit and push ```git add <arxiv-id>-<technique-name>.md && git commit -m "added <arxiv-id>-<technique-name>.md" && git push origin <branch-name>```

3. Open a PR on original repo, add an overview and dont forget to tag and ping me.

4. PR will probably be merged in a day. *Thanks for contributing!*
